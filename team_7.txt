• Fish Classification & Regression Project

→ 1. Classification Models Implemented:

• Random Forest:
• Accuracy: 0.936
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: High (especially across most classes)
• Why Good: High accuracy and strong performance across all species. Handles non-linear data well.
• Why Bad: Can be computationally intensive and less interpretable.

• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
• Accuracy: 0.930
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: Very good, but slightly affected by class imbalance.
• Why Good: Simple, effective for small datasets, no training time.
• Why Bad: Slow during prediction, affected by noisy data.

• Support Vector Machine (SVM):
• Accuracy: 0.875
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: Moderate, especially low for minority classes.
• Why Good: Good for high-dimensional data, strong theoretical foundation.
• Why Bad: Lower accuracy here, sensitive to parameter tuning, not ideal for large datasets.

• Logistic Regression:
• Accuracy: 0.916
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: Good, especially when data is well-distributed.
• Why Good: Fast, easy to implement, interpretable.
• Why Bad: Assumes linear boundaries, underperforms with complex relationships.

• Decision Tree:
• Accuracy: 0.925
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: High, but risk of overfitting certain classes.
• Why Good: Easy to interpret, no need for feature scaling.
• Why Bad: Prone to overfitting, less stable.

• Naive Bayes:
• Accuracy: 0.928
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: Balanced, but affected by feature assumptions.
• Why Good: Fast, handles high-dimensional input well.
• Why Bad: Strong independence assumption between features, which might not hold here.

• Neural Network (MLP Classifier):
• Accuracy: 0.933
• Precision, Recall, F1-score: Very high, well-balanced across classes.
• Why Good: Can model complex relationships, high accuracy.
• Why Bad: Requires more data and time to train, harder to interpret.


Best Model: Random Forest — highest accuracy, stable performance
We tested 6 classifiers and selected Random Forest as the best-performing model for fish species classification.


→ 2. Regression Models Implemented:

• Linear Regression:
• RMSE: 0.4259

• Why Good: Simple, interpretable.
• Why Bad: Doesn’t capture non-linear relationships well.

• Polynomial Regression:
• RMSE: 1.5401757945667074e-15

→ 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Checked distributions of length, weight, and W/L ratio.
• Used scatter plots to visualize length vs. weight.
• Plotted boxplots and histograms for species-specific distributions.
• Observed a strong correlation between length and weight.
• Confirmed W/L ratio was slightly redundant.

→ 4. Evaluation Metrics Used:
• Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
• Confusion Matrix
• RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
• R² Score
